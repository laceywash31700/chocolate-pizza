  <p>For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stire to dissolve. Halve all<br>
  of the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until<br>
  you have a chucky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside and let cool completely.</p> 
  <p>Ice cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar until sugar is completely<br>
  dissolved and the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and wait until the<br>
fig mixture is cooled.</p>
<p>Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process according to manufacturer<br>
instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and the nuts.<br>
Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or glass tupperware. Freeze for<br>
at least two hours before serving.</p>
